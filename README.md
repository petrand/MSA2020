# MSA2020
Phase 1 Data Science submission for MSA 2020
Work for the first part is done using notebooks and is located in Part1DatasetBuilding folder, 
Work for part2 was done on my device, due to slow processing on jupyter notebooks when testing hyperparameters. 
Because of that the modelling is in python3 file rather than notebook. 
All the code snippets are explained in report appendix.
